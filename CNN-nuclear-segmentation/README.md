## Description: 
- This code allows a user to train a pre-built convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify pixels within an image as being ???.
- The example images that I have provided (those which will be used to train and test the CNN) is biological data. You can see bright spots in the images. These are the nuclei of human cells, genetically modified to fluoresce when illuminated with a laser. Specifically, these images were captured using a spinning disk confocal miscroscope. You can read more about these microscopes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy)
- Once trained, microscopy images of cell nuclei can be easily segmented (numerically seperated from other pixel classes, e.g. background pixels)
