## Description:   
- This purpose of this package is to allow a user to fit a linear line of best fit to a 2D data set.
- The user selects the data in question, and a cost function/gradient descent algorithm is used to calculate suitable values of 'm' (the coefficient of gradient) and 'c' (the y-intercept). 
  - To find out more about gradient descent and cost functions, I'd recommend visiting [Andrew NG's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). 
- The code will save a graph displaying the 2D data with the linear line of best fit. 
- The code will also output values of 'm' and 'c'. 
- For each ```.py``` file provided, there is an accompanying ```.ipynb``` file for those who use JupiterLab.
