## Package architecture:
- ResNet-HistoNet:
    * This is where the main code is stored.
    * There are module files (these contain the individual functions) and RUNME files (these actually call (use) the functions).
    * There are .py files for general purpose IDEs, and .ipynb files for JupyterLab.
- img:
    * This is where images are stored. These images are used to illustrate this README document.
- .gitignore:
    * I use software called 'Git Bash' to sync my local files with those within this GitHub repositry. The .gitignore file contains a list of directories (e.g. text files with project notes), and prevents Git Bash from uplodaing them; I don't want to clutter up this repo!
- LICENCE.txt:
    * The licence explaining how this code can be used.
